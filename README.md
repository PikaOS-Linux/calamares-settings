# Vanilla OS Calamares Settings
This package is based on the original calamares-settings-ubuntu. This is not
meant to be used on any distributions other than Vanilla OS as it will not
handle conflicts with other distributions.

Calamares is just a momentary installer, we will move to the GNOME os-installer
when it is ready and when all the dependencies are available in Ubuntu.
